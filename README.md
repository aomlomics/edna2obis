## Introduction
**Rationale:**

DNA derived data are increasingly being used to document taxon 
occurrences. To ensure these data are useful to the broadest possible 
community, [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/) published a guide entitled "[Publishing DNA-derived 
data through biodiversity data platforms](https://docs.gbif-uat.org/publishing-dna-derived-data/1.0/en/)." 
This guide is supported by the [DNA derived data extension](https://tools.gbif.org/dwca-validator/extension.do?id=http://rs.gbif.org/terms/1.0/DNADerivedData) 
for [Darwin Core](https://dwc.tdwg.org/), which incorporates [MIxS](https://gensc.org/mixs/) 
terms into the Darwin Core standard. 

This use case draws on both the guide and the extension to illustrate 
how to incorporate a DNA derived data extension file into a Darwin Core
archive. Please note that the extension remains subject to change at this 
time and remapping may be required as terms evolve.

**Project abstract:**

The example data employed in this use case are from marine 
filtered seawater samples collected at a nearshore station in 
Monterey Bay, California, USA. They were collected by CTD
rosette and filtered by a peristaltic pump system. Subsequently, 
they underwent metabarcoding for the 18S V9 region. The resulting
ASVs, their assigned taxonomy, and the metadata associated with their
collection are the input data for the conversion scripts 
presented here.

A selection of samples from this collection were included in the 
publication "[Environmental DNA reveals seasonal shifts and potential 
interactions in a marine community](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-14105-1)"
 which was published with open access in *Nature Communications* in 2020.
