# edna2obis Configuration File
# USERS of edna2obis, EDIT THIS FILE!!
# Here, you specify where all of your data is, set a few other parameters, and set parameters related to the taxonomic assignment.

# STEP 1
# Assign sheets from your FAIRe Excel metadata file
# NOTE: Left side is what edna2obis calls that data. Right side must be the actual sheetname from your FAIRe Excel metadata file:
sampleMetadata: "sampleMetadata"
experimentRunMetadata: "experimentRunMetadata"
projectMetadata: "projectMetadata"

excel_file: "raw-v3/FAIRe_NOAA_noaa-aoml-gomecc4_SHARING.xlsx"
FAIRe_NOAA_checklist: "raw-v3/FAIRe_NOAA_checklist_v1.0.xlsx"

# STEP 2
# Assign pathnames for your raw data. Each analysis must have 2 raw data files associated with it.
datafiles:
  gomecc4_18s_p1-6_v2024.10_241122:
    taxonomy_file: "raw-v3/asvTaxaFeatures_gomecc4_18s_p1-6_v2024.10_241122.tsv"
    occurrence_file: "raw-v3/table_gomecc4_18s_p1-6_v2024.10_241122.tsv"
  gomecc4_16s_p3-6_v2024.10_241122:
    taxonomy_file: "raw-v3/asvTaxaFeatures_gomecc4_16s_p3-6_v2024.10_241122.tsv"
    occurrence_file: "raw-v3/table_gomecc4_16s_p3-6_v2024.10_241122.tsv"
  gomecc4_16s_p1-2_v2024.10_241122:
    taxonomy_file: "raw-v3/asvTaxaFeatures_gomecc4_16s_p1-2_v2024.10_241122.tsv"
    occurrence_file: "raw-v3/table_gomecc4_16s_p1-2_v2024.10_241122.tsv"
  # Add other analysis runs here, following the pattern:
  # your_analysis_run_name:
  #   taxonomy_file: "path/to/your/asvTaxaFeatures_your_analysis_run_name.tsv"
  #   occurrence_file: "path/to/your/table_your_analysis_run_name.tsv"

# STEP 3:
# However you denote control / blank samples, specify here
# 'skip_sample_types' is the column name in your metadata, and 'negative control' and 'positive control' are values in that column
skip_sample_types:
  - "negative control"
  - "positive control"

skip_columns:
  - "samp_collect_notes"
  - "date_modified"
  - "modified_by"

# STEP 4:
# Specify which API you would like to use to assign taxonomy. Options are either WoRMS or GBIF
# Taxonomic Assignment Parameters:
taxonomic_api_source: "WoRMS"
# taxonomic_api_source: "GBIF"

# STEP 5:
# Define which assays should not consider 'species' rank in their taxonomic assignment.
# This is because certain assays (for example, 16S) species' level assignments are not useful / correct.
# Additionally, for example, 18S species' level assignments are good, and we want them!
# This should be the exact 'assay_name' value as found in your analysisMetadata sheets (cell D3)
# and subsequently in the 'assay_name' column of the intermediate occurrence.csv
assays_to_skip_species_match:
  - "ssu16sv4v5-emp"  # Example, replace with your actual assay names, comment out if you want species-level to be used in taxonomic assignment
  # - "another_16s_assay_name_if_any"

# Optional local reference database (WoRMS only) - speeds up matching significantly!
use_local_reference_database: true  # or false  
local_reference_database_path: "raw-v3/pr2_version_5.0.0_taxonomy.xlsx"

# Optional parameters (will use defaults if not specified)
# Number of processes for matching (0 means use all available CPUs)
worms_n_proc: 0
gbif_n_proc: 0

# Output directory (will be created if it doesn't exist)
output_dir: "processed-v3/"
