Amplicons were batch normalized using Invitrogen SequalPrep DNA Normalization plates and recovered product was pooled. The pool was QC’d and quantified using a combination of Qubit dsDNA HS, Agilent 4200 TapeStation HS DNA1000, and Invitrogen Collibri Library Quantification qPCR assays.","The Genomics Core performed secondary PCR using dual indexed, Illumina-compatible primers targeting the Fluidigm CS1/CS2 oligomers at the ends of the primary PCR products.
